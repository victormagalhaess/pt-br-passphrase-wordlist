EAST MEETS WEST
 one that says East, the other says west. Japan has sent a mission to San Francisco. In San Francisco, the Japanese are surprised by the American culture. One American, Gus Taylor, and his gang steal all the gold from the mission and make their way in to the desert. One of the samurai of the mission chases after the gang into the desert. He is joined by a young American boy, Sam, whose father was killed by the gang leader. The group picks up a variety of people along the way to New Mexico. The Japanese and the Americans on the trip share parts of their own cultures with each other. The group of vigilantes eventually makes it to New Mexico and finds the gang. They take back their stolen gold and return to San Francisco. ×

 Banner orders Deputy Sheriff Bill Yount, who is in Banner’s pay, to arrest Kane. But Kane has the sympathy of Banner’s daughter, Jane, who notifies Inskip of Kane’s plight, and Inskip arrives in time to prevent a lynching. Sheriff Kiscade dismisses the murder charge for lack of evidence. Brazos then sets out to find the killer of his friend. Bess Bannister, Jane’s sister, is in love with the Banner ranch foreman, Bard Macky, and knowing that Bard killed Tyrell and that Kane will track him down, then hampers Kane’s mission somewhat by pretending to be in love with him. ×

 director Robert N. Bradbury and supervisor Lindsley Parsons wrote a song for Tommy Bupp, one of the actually good kid actors of the time who proved real quick-like that singing wasn’t his strong suit, while Robert Emmett Tansey worked three jobs under three names… Robert Emmett on story and screenplay, Robert Tansey as the production manager and Al Lane as the assistant director. And, for a change, music director Frank Sanucci actually earned a composers’ credit as he did write a song… Written by Les Adams ×

Brusquely, Dellaplane offers her 1/350,000th of his time, but as their paths cross and she sees his courage and resolve, feelings change. After he finds a surprising connection between her missing husband and a local teacher, Irène makes Dellaplane an offer. This man of action hesitates: has he missed his only chance? ×

Alexander the Great
 a magnificent warrior who many believed was part god - this was Alexander the Great (Richard Burton), the legendary Greek hero hailed by his countrymen as “The King of Kings”. Born in 356 B.C. into a turbulent world of political unrest, educated by Aristotle (Barry Jones) and chosen to lead his people in the grand tradition of his powerful father (Fredric March), this glamorous world conqueror rose above all conflict to unite the continents of Europe and Asia to become one of the most celebrated rulers of all time! Written, produced and directed by Oscar - winner Robert Rossen and featuring the extraordinary Claire Bloom and a remarkable cast of thousands, this stunning portrait of one of history’s most fascinating figures is colossal entertainment and an amazing spectacle. ×

 too bad, because it’s something of a knockout. A brilliant, gripping portrait of the era of “Red Terror” during the civil war that followed the Bolshevik revolution, The Seventh Companion offers a superlative character study in General Adamov (Andrei Popov), a law professor in the tsarist army, who is incarcerated by the Bolshevik secret police along with many other members of the bourgeoisie. Finally released into the new world of the Soviet Union, the resigned officer finds that he has lost everything from his old life except a mantel clock that he carries through the night from place to place, until he ends up, like Rossellini’s inmate seeking readmission to prison in Dovè la liberta?, back where he started. ×

The Mahabharata
 indeed, its very title means “the great story of mankind.” Brook and  writer Jean-Claude Carriere worked for eight years to develop this epic concerning two sides of a royal family, the Pandavas and the Kauravas, whose struggle leads to a fascinating voyage of emotions, passion and vision of glory. Briefly, the Mahabharata is a tale of two rival sets of brothers, cousins to eachother, each born into royalty and with divinely guided paths in life. The result, however, is a great war, death, destruction - a vast epic. ×

On November 26, 1942, hundreds of Jews are picked up by the police in the middle of the night and are transported to the dock in Oslo. Unknowing and frightened men, women, children, sick and old are forced on board the awaiting German cargo ship “SS DONAU”. The ship leaves with 532 Norwegian Jews onboard

He meets an old Czech resident Skurek (Lubomír Kostelka), German women working in the forest, soldiers from the engineering units removing the mines, and a young first lieutenant. At night he dreams about his dead father whom he loved very much. This is why he runs away from home when he finds out that the lieutenant is courting his mother. ×

 now transferred to UCLA Film and TV Archive. This film provides an almost unknown perspective on the Vietnam War, the Republic of Vietnam, and the RVN Army. The stage is the Republic of Vietnam, and the scenes portray a time during the Vietnam War as experienced by the Southern Vietnamese people, themselves. Phi, a soldier, longing to take Lien off to their private, imaginary space (the Purple Horizon), understands what his duty and commitment as a soldier is. Lien is a singer whose style is reminiscent of the “Torch” singers of the early 1930s. She desperately longs to escape the world with Phi to their purple. ×

The Despoiler
 but since Ince was known far and wide as a glory-hogger, it’s also possible that one of his talented lieutenants wielded the megaphone. A Civil War drama, The Despoiler refuses to take sides, demonstrating that there are heroes and villains in both camps. Capturing a small town, Colonel Charles K. French orders his men to reclaim the funds raised for the enemy by the townsfolk. French’s drunken, lacivious second-in-command Frank Keenan intends to extort money from the citizens by threatening the virtue of the town’s female population. ×

 it’s a marriage which exists only on paper.  Among all the men Ulyssa flirts with, there is one for which she has genuine affection:  Stefen Marbach, an upright and sincere man, far superior to her other men.  And, indeed, the two are honest with one another about their feelings, but the outbreak of the First World War separates them.  Sometime later, Ulyssa finds out that not only her husband, but Stefan, too, has fallen in battle. The news of this disaster leads her to reconsider and eventually give in to the constant urgings of the Viennese merchant Reindl.  Ulyssa joins Reindl in Vienna and lives a life of wealth and comfort, until one day, Stefan shows up. ×

Struggle
 the woman is forced to get married. She tries to seek revenge but is killed. When the man is released from prison, he joins the People’s Volunteer Army but is killed in battle. The film was significant in its time. Runje Shaw had imported advanced American audio film equipment and technology in 1931, making this one of the first sound films in China. As one of Unique’s few ‘progress’ films, it also reflects that this ‘entertainment-only’, apolitical film company, under the left-wing influences in society, also needed to make films with topics such as the war effort and that criticise the bourgeoisie. Struggle is a joint effort among the best of talents in front of and behind the camera, and is also the only surviving work of director Qiu Qixiang. ×

 but the film made a virtue of this description and a statement of pride. A national character is expressed — pioneers who had “helped make this country what it is: happy, prosperous and free” — and is used to underpin the soldiers’ mission. This extract expressed a pride that country lads had helped make the nation and were now fighting for it. Subsequently, the success of New Zealand soldiers was often explained in terms of their alleged rural upbringing. ×

 then it follows a producer, directors, composers, editors, writers, and actors to Hollywood: some succeeded and many found no work. Among those profiled are Erich Pommer, Joseph May, Ernst Lubitsch, Fritz Lang, Billy Wilder, and Peter Lorre. Once in Hollywood, these exiles helped each other, housed new arrivals, and raised money so others could escape. Some worked on anti-Nazi films, like Casablanca. The themes and lighting of German Expressionism gave rise in Hollywood to film noir. ×

Many reviews had expected Bergman to put his very personal stamp on the production. Instead they experienced ‘a clean Molière’ and were struck by Bergman’s faithfulness to the original mise-en-scene and to the classical rhythm of Molière’s text. ×

She finds him mysterious and he finds her charming, and for Posy it is an opportunity to try on confidence for size. Posy is reluctant to take it any further than petty flirting, but her cousin Laura, her polar opposite, pushes her for one last fling before settling down with Tom, her one and only. Posy’s growing desire to break free allows her to exercise her inner self with Jack, an alter ego she’s created called the Queen of Sin. Little does Posy know, as she’s being swept up by Jack, she’s really making a deal with the devil. ×

Telly Savalas, a costar of the Burt Lancaster vehicle Birdman of Alcatraz, also guest starred in the 1980 film.

 Mrs Culfeathers, Dolly, Doreen and the irrepressible Magrit, all meet at The Steamie to do the traditional family wash before the New Year.  The Steamie is a hilarious cameo of Glasgow’s social history where the washing was always easier to do when the Women shared their laugher and sorrow and a scandalous supply of gossip.  This is the definitive version of the most popular play of the last 20 years with the all star cast of Dorothy Paul as Magrit, Eileen McCallum as Dolly, Kate Murphy as Doreen, Sheila McDonald as Mrs Culfeathers and a very young Peter Mullan as Andy, the whisky loving handy man. ×

Now 32 years old and residing in an abandoned Uruguayan slaughterhouse, Rosa has become one of Hollywood’s foremost composers, specialising in Westerns. He also has a beautiful 19-year-old fiancee, Esmeralda, but he pays her little heed, instead lavishing his attentions on a black mare named Bola. One day, a group of men attired as cowboys arrive at the abattoir and kill both Rosa and Bola

A Visit from Miss Prothero
 his former secretary, Peggy Prothero, has come to visit. A brash, charmless woman who seems to take no pleasure in anything but putting people down, Miss Prothero wants to fill her old boss in on all the changes that have taken place at work since he left. Dodsworth isn’t very curious, and as the visit wears on it puts a little strain on his politeness and patience. Miss Prothero doesn’t enjoy it much either, but lingers on as there’s a bombshell she wants to drop. The docketing system Dodsworth introduced thirty years earlier, which revolutionised the firm, has been scrapped by her adored new boss Mr Skinner. The crowning achievement of Dodsworth’s career has just become obsolete, and she wants to tell him all about it. ×

Post-Socialism+Retro Avantgarde+Irwin
 a post industrial, post modern, post national, post colonial, post structural society, that can be perhaps summarized in the concept of post socialism? The disintegration of the concept of ideology means that notions are no longer clear. Because we think that we are outside an ideological context, but perhaps we ourselves are the centre of the ideology.  It is this idea that corresponds with the thoughts about post socialism in the nineties, and probably the post ideological society of late capitalism as well. The end of the ideological period then perhaps seems imminent. These thoughts are considered in this philosophical media reflection, based on documentary fragments, statements by Peter Weibel and Slavoj Zizek and the works of three artists: Mladen Stilinovic (Zagreb), “Kasimir Malevich” (pseudonym, Belgrade) and IRWIN (Ljubljana). ×

Commitments
 overly competitive stockbroker who thinks money is the most important thing in life. Her health suffers from that and she ends up having to take time off and spend time away from the hustle and bustle of New York City. She heads south to reconnect with her estranged foster mother, finds out something about family and true love. She ends up falling in love with Van (A. Payne). It’s really a good love story about two people who really don’t want to be in love, but it’s kind of forced on them. It’s a situation that neither one of them want to have that experience of being vulnerable or in love. ×

A Mind To Kill
 the town’s inhabitants are panic-stricken. A serial killer is on the loose, and as yet more horrific murders take place, the search for clues becomes a desperate race against time. A tense psychological thriller with a chilling climax, this television movie introduced the charismatic, dedicated Welsh detective Noel Bain (Philip Madoc), a man with a passion for defending the innocent and an infallible instinct which the sharpest criminal minds cannot match. Also starring Hywel Bennett as Doctor Lewis, the feature-length drama won a BAFTA Cymru award and initiated the highly acclaimed, darkly authentic crime series which ran between 1997 and 2004. ×

 the 12-year-old has a good chance of getting a solo part in the choir for her class Christmas concert. If only it weren’t for Silja, who is making Brynhildur’s life difficult with her bullying. Even though Brynhildur hasn’t done a thing to provoke Silja. It’s not until she gets up the courage to talk to her father about it that Brynhildur begins to understand what’s behind Silja’s behaviour. At her father’s suggestion, Brynhildur invites the entire class to her birthday party. She sees it as a possible way to win sympathy from Silja and become friends with her. But the plan appears to fail – Silja organises a competing party! ×

 a beautiful woman that discovers her boyfriend’s bloody scarf in her apartment following a black-out episode. This unearthed white scarf covered in crimson drives May to attempt suicide. May is taken to a psychiatric ward under the care and influence of Dr. Ballard, a fifty-eight year old psychiatrist/acclaimed author, played by Eric Roberts. May is immediately thrown into seclusion. Detective James Harding, played by Jake Busey, appears to question May about a horrific murder. This questioning thrusts May into narrating an in-depth story about an unnamed woman’s involvement with unsavory characters leading to multiple murders. Will May regain her sanity, restore her normal life and unravel the mystery of her true love? Only time will tell. ×

 still, the company was a welcome harbor for character actors who aspired to occasional leading roles. In Boss of Big Town, veteran supporting player John Litel is top-billed as crusading city market official Michael Lynn. When a criminal gang muscles in on the local food distribution markets, Lynn vows to throw the rascals out. First, however, he pretends to join the villains as a paid government stooge, the better to find out the identity of the “Mister Big” behind the distribution racket. The exposure of the “mystery villain” will come as a shock to fans of the 1927 Cecil B. DeMille epic The King of Kings–but not to dyed-in-the-wool movie buffs. ×

Damien, a local businessman, is pressuring Alain to expand Le Detour, and cut his nephew Xavier in for a percentage as a manager. While Alain waffles on Damien’s proposal, Xavier offers Antoine a chance to make some money under the table by delivering some drugs to a cadre of dealers. Antoine makes the drop and picks up the payment, but runs off with the money rather than bringing it back to Xavier, which proves to have tragic consequences for Antoine and his friends. ×

 her father or strangers should make no difference.”  Respectable Police Commissioner Josephine reinvestigates an insignificant murder case of a 11 years old girl. The murderer is the mother of the victim, Becky. Under intense interrogation, Becky refused to admit that she knew all along that her boyfriend was raping her little daughter at home. The harsh interrogation drives Becky into killing herself. What is the truth that the raging Commissioner is trying to find out? What is the seemingly defenseless mother hiding? Or is she acually telling the truth? Is the phrase, “A woman is born to give her body to men.” the whole truth? ×

 finding ingenious solutions to pay homemade, homage to the original film. The show is a crushing flop but fate gives them a second chance to find their audience. Whilst still adjusting to the idea that their serious show is actually a comedy, the group find out they’re suddenly being whisked from their village hall to a London West End theatre to perform this accidental masterpiece for one night only. With wobbly sets, awkward acting and special effects requiring ’more luck than judgement’, will their West End debut be alright on the night? This bus driving crew are our space heroes. Their bus station is our space station. Dorset is outer-space and where is the Alien? It’s behind you! ×

In the midst of a flight to London, a number of their passengers mysteriously disappear, and chaos takes hold as a number of vehicles on the ground and in the air are suddenly unmanned. Meanwhile, Buck Williams, a television journalist, is pondering the rash of sudden disappearances as he works on a report about Dr. Chaim Rosenzweig, an Israeli scientist who has devised a formula that would make any soil on earth easy to cultivate. However, Buck wonders if there’s more to Rosenzweig than he first imagined when he discovers the doctor is in cahoots with two multi-millionaires who plan to broker the invention to promote their own agenda of international domination. ×

 in Elle’s culture, this is viewed as a marriage proposal. Eleven years later, Elle returns to Earth in order to marry Ataru — by which time not only had he forgotten the events of his childhood, but he was also going out with Lum. The rest of the plot focuses on Lum’s attempts to prevent the marriage.  The film was directed by Mamoru Oshii who was mad at the many requests that the producer made of him to alter the movie. Rumiko Takahashi considers this film her favorite and it is the most true to the original series. ×

 blood spreads from an invisible source which becomes visible as the bleeding man dies. He carries with him a suicide note dedicated to his only friend, who is also an invisible man. An eager young reporter tracks down Takemitsu Nanjo, a war veteran who makes his living visibly, painting his face like a clown’s and carrying advertising signs. His favorite neighbor is a little blind girl whose mother is running afoul of local gangsters. The gangsters have been terrorizing the city as “the invisible gang,” wrapping themselves up in scarves and trenchcoats so as to be visible to their victims, even though they are supposed to be invisible underneath. Once they discover Nanjo, who is defending his only friends, they beat him and leave him for dead. ×

We see a variety of approaches to survival, from the artist and engineer who trade for their needs, to the surfers and woodsmen who fish and hunt, to the scavengers, and a communal farm. We also see how the community deals with those who threaten it, and how the youth are growing up with different values from those who knew our world. ×

Good Morning Althea
 Galory, a young boy who apparently is part human/part Crest person, and Althea, who is entirely a Crest person. Seems the Earth and the Crest people were at war for 300 years so there’s still a lot of bad feelings present. The ship Galory, Nikolai and others are on is ambushed and almost everyone killed by some kind of automated attack ships from a huge Crest ship that has been taken over by an automaton. Galory, Nikolai and Althea go to the ship to try and see if there are any survivors of an advanced party from Galory’s ship that can be saved, and to see if they can destroy the Type 38 automaton in the ship’s core. ×

But what the couple think is their scam begs the question does he really have the power? It’s a question that haunts him and only intensifies his inner demons. Scarred for life, his childhood abuse from his evil father won’t soon go away. He finds temporary refuge at the bottom of each bottle of tequila and endless grams of cocaine that goes up his nose. His childhood demons will not subside, neither will his vices. In the end, his powers serve as a blessing and a curse.

To prove this the professor promises the hand of his daughter Rózsi (Katalin Karády) and all his possessions to the one who is willing to try the ‘space travel’ with him in his machine.

Kazuma is a young mercenary who lives in the Lost Ground, looking for any work he can find to sustain his livelihood within the harsh environment. He is one of the few people that are gifted with the Alter ability, which allows him to plaster his right arm and torso with a metallic alloy.

She looks out of the window and sees hundreds of identical ships orbiting a green planet. Ruth remembers the pledge she made to begin a new life, light years away from the earth. Suddenly there’s a noise from the other side of a dividing screen and Ruth realises that she’s not alone. ×

 featuring digital remastering and some new footage.  A strange environmental phenomenon 22 years ago in the Kanazawa prefecture caused the land to split and protrude upwards reaching unprecedented heights, creating the secluded area known as The Lost Ground. Kazuma is a young mercenary who lives in the Lost Ground, looking for any work he can find to sustain his livelihood within the harsh environment. He is one of the few people that are gifted with the Alter ability, which allows him to plaster his right arm and torso with a metallic alloy. When this mercenary encounters HOLY, an order whose purpose is to suppress and capture what they call Native Alter Users, and one of the elite members of HOLY, Ryuho, an epic rivalry begins. ×

 wildfires burn on heaths and panic is reported by newspapers. In the city, newspapers carry stories of earthquakes and changes affecting ‘the planets’. Extreme weather conditions are experienced. The changes are discussed on the streets. The day of final judgement is predicted by some. Uncertain of what is happening people hide indoors. A new day dawns and people venture outside. A large bright object fills the sky, collides with and destroys the earth. (East Anglian Film Archive) ×

Harrowing yet leavened by humour, the story includes street kids, ancestral pariahs and, as you’d expect, yakuzas ×

AniMen - Triton Force
 these humans had evolved into a new race: the Frogmen.If history (and genetics for that matter) shows us anything, it is that there is always variety.The genetic “success” of the Frogmen was also mirrored by the “achievements” of another group of human descent: the Cockroaches, otherwise known as the T-zhu Alliance. The brutal T-Hy poured out into the galaxy seeking new territories, resources, and the data crystals left by the original human explorers. The T-Hy’s material driven hunger broke the peaceful lives of the Frogmen forcing them to take up arms in order to stop the T-Hy’s insatiable ambitions. So began the MALO war. ×

 a group of scientists left a capsule in a secret bunker to be found containing information on how to prevent the sun from dying based on technology techniques in the century they lived among. This was code-named, “Project Sun,” and was found in 2091 by former NASA Engineer named Eugene Patterson. Shortly after 2050 a meteoroid struck Earth and eliminated 70% of its population.

To recapture his attention, Palagna tries sorcery, and in the process comes under the spell of the sorcerer, publicly humiliating Ivan, who then fights the sorcerer. The lively rhythms of village life, the work and the holidays, the pageant and revelry of weddings and funerals, the change of seasons, and nature’s beauty give proportion to Ivan’s tragedy. ×

Young Bess
 the daughter rose to become England’s greatest monarch – the brilliant and cunning Queen Elizabeth I. Jean Simmons portrays young Bess in this rich tapestry of a film that traces the tumultuous, danger-fraught years from Elizabeth’s birth to her unexpected ascension to the throne at a mere 25. Charles Laughton reprises his Academy Award®-winning* role as her formidable father Henry VIII. Deborah Kerr plays her last stepmother (and Henry’s last of six wives), gentle Catherine Parr. And Simmons’ then real-life husband, Stewart Granger, adds heroics as Lord Admiral Thomas Seymour. In a resplendent world of adventure, romance and court intrigue, Young Bess reigns. ×

Elizabeth, stung by Max’s refusal to marry, catches Jack’s eye, but the friendship seems innocent. Lena, who works with Max, likes him and realizes she can manipulate his jealousy and maybe engineer his split from Elizabeth. When she’s sure Elizabeth is with a man, she calls Max at work, sending him home to confront the lovers. Then, Lena feels guilty and takes off for Max’s apartment. What’s really going on? Who’s with Elizabeth? ×

 she eventually confronts him with his opportunism and hypocrisy. It is a sardonic portrayal of the German Democratic Republic’s judicial system and its social implications. The film was banned by officials as an anti-socialist, pessimistic and revisionist attack on the state. It henceforth lent its name to all the banned films of 1965, which became known as the “Rabbit Films.” After its release in 1990, The Rabbit Is Me earned critical praise as one of the most important and courageous works ever made in East Germany. It was screened at The Museum of Modern Art in 2005 as part of the film series Rebels with a Cause: The Cinema of East Germany. ×

Larsen’s snakeskin-covered guitar and Rajae’s liquid gold voice could be heaven, if only everything from his drug-induced visions to her music-buff pimp didn’t get in the way.

For these punk Romeo and Juliet, maybe the answer lies in a song - the one they’ve been writing and dreaming together : Zanka Contact ×

There she meets his adjutant, Captain Denny Roark. Roark is a dashing young man who reminds Julia thoroughly of her lost love. Soon she finds she is indeed capable of love, but it is Roark with whom she falls in love, not her husband. As warfare with the local tribes heats up and as Wister gains awareness of the unconsummated romance growing between his wife and best friend, tragedy lurks. ×

The Great Victor Herbert
 instead, the writers allow the famed composer’s works to speak for themselves. In the tradition of one of his own operettas, Herbert spends most of his time patching up the shaky marriage between tenor John Ramsey (Allan Jones) and Louise Hall (Mary Martin). Many of Herbert’s most famous compositions are well in evidence, including “Ah! Sweet Mystery of Life”, “March of the Toys” and “Kiss Me Again”, the latter performed con brio by teenaged coloratura Susanna Foster. Evidently, the producers were able to secure the film rights for the Herbert songs, but not for the stage productions in which they appeared, which may explain such bizarre interpolations as having a song from Naughty Marietta. ×

 they don’t have children, he‘s a musician, she’s an actress. Invited to dinner for an announcement, their friends think it’s going to be a marriage announcement, but instead discover that decided to break up: but without drama or emotional rifts, staying friends with each other.

 having long been pursued by Eric, she apparently accedes and accompanies him to an apartment and, per her plan, enter the wrong one. There, they find Carol’s best friend, Charlotte, and John hiding in a closet. The latter, showing more nerve than good sense, goes into a rage and berates Carol for her apparent philandering. The battle continues at home, where their daughter Janet informs them that because of them, she and Paul have given up on the idea of marriage, but are going away together, anyway. Carol and John trail them to a hotel and find them in twin beds, whereupon John, armed with a fire-ax, summons a justice of the peace and demands a fire-ax version of a shotgun wedding. ×

 between the memories and unhealed wounds of his past, stands Ernesto. When his good friend Ricardo calls him one day and proposes to get together after 25 years, they decide to gather all the members of the “old gang” in order to revive those old feelings the best way they know how, through some good old rock n’ roll. Amongst one of Ernesto’s encounters is Ana, an old love who will bring a twisting unexpected turn into his life.  The old gang is comprised of Ricardo’s depressive, hypochondriac wife Ana and her socially-conscious former lover Ernesto, a journalist who left Ana years ago to pursue his political ideologies in post-revolutionary Cuba. ×

 besides, he is nominated for the post of governor in Martinica. He promised never to forget Marie, but as time goes by, she will accept to marry a rich and unscrupulous man, Monsieur de Saint-André. When her husband is appointed to serve in Martinica as General Commissioner, Marie demands to go with him. At her arrival, all sorts of trouble arrive: pirates take action against travelers and goods, rotten deals set the two officers against each other, and finally jealousy settles to make things worse. ~ Written by Artemis-9 ×

Victoria, and the Pursuit of Happiness
 but very unsatisfied with her private life. She is all consumed by her high pressure career and there is little time left to find love. It all changes when she meets Fat, a rap singer that becomes her client. Although at first Victoria has reservations because of her prejudices, she discovers in him a person that, unlike her, enjoys his life and follows his dreams. Through their relationship Victoria learns there is more to life than succeeding, there is also living. Perhaps love is meant to happen instead of being pursued. ×

 loving parents, megabucks and girls, girls and girls. But when he first set his sights on pretty kampung lass Nurul Ain, it was indeed love at first sight. Nurul is a salesgirl in the departmental store and takes night classes for self-development. With the help of his driver and confidante, Osman, Daniel sets out to woo Nurul by pretending to be plain ol’ Ahmad. He has had his share of bad experiences when women want him because of his wealth and not for who he is. However, Nurul’s uncle who is having financial difficulties wants to marry her off to a rich widower. To halt his plans, Daniel explained who he really is. Feeling betrayed that the one she loved and trusted most had lied to her, Nurul could not accept Daniel back. Can Daniel woo her back? Can he now overcome the insurmountable obstacles to win back the heart of the woman he loves? ×

After having the everyday breakfast Walter makes the last hay of the summer when he listens to the news on his tractor radio that a gigantic asteroid is approaching the earth in a great speed. Unfortunately, all attempts to avert the total destruction of mankind within 16 hours are in vain.

 music by Chopin.  The passionate tale of Marguerite Gautier and Armand Duval unfolds ingeniously through a drama-within-a-drama as they meet at the theatre during a performance of Manon Lescaut. So begin their romantic adventures in Paris, brought to life by Neumeier’s intense and refined choreographic language. Chopin’s ravishing music highlights this exceptional neo-classical ballet, featuring the star dancers of the Paris Opéra Ballet. This lavish production, filmed live at the Palais Garnier in High Definition and full surround sound, is all about love, passion, danger and glorious dancing from one of the best ballet companies in the world.  John Neumeier has created a ballet in which emotions go crescendo … Agnes Letestu, the great dramatic heroine, triumphs in this ballet danced to music by Chopin. ×

 she pulls out her left foot and sees an engagement ring on the toe that corresponds to her ring finger. Kit asks her to marry him. A week before their wedding day, Snow gets into an accident and dies, but a sympathetic angel-in-training named Michael, who wears a bright orange shirt, brings her back to life and gives her three days for the wedding. The day before she has to leave Kit, Kit falls asleep while watching TV and Snow whispers into his ear: I love you so much. I want to be with you forever, but I must leave tomorrow night. A couple hours later, Kit wakes up and tells her that he had the strangest dream where she spoke with a husky and sexy voice, but she said she had to go somewhere and promises her that he’ll be there with her, no matter what. ×

The thrill seeking in one case and the desire to find a way out of the family dead end in the other lead these couples to a New Year’s Eve swinger party. A sexual experiment in both couples, initiated by only one of the partners, turns into a series of incidents and ends in failure. To the surprise of themselves and their “legitimate” halves, the heroes reveal real feelings and strong mutual affection. ×

She accepts, but then is repelled at the thought of the frog eating and drinking with her, etc., but her Father makes her do so.

 where conspiracy rules the day and death stalks the night… Death in the form of the Skull Man, a literal Grim Reaper whose skeletal grin presages grisly mayhem and murder, even to the monstrous mutants that haunt the city’s underworlds! To investigate a bizarre slaying, journalist Minagami Hayato and photographer Kiriko Mamiya must stalk this ultimate predator, through a festering cadaver of a city where the corruption flows in rivers as deep and foul as the sins of the reigning elite, and unearth a secret so shocking that an entire city has been turned into a tomb to contain! In a nightmarish necropolis where nothing is as it seems, vengeance comes in the form of a living Death’s-Head! ×

 the moment where they are directly responsible for the extinction of an entire species’  Duck hunting in Australia is a very contentious issue and every year hunters and protesters clash.  The experimental side is evidenced with the lack of dialog, non-linear narrative and a ‘score’ by Belgian sound designer Christina Clar. The majority of the sound tracking and design was completed before the edit in Australia, thus reversing the usual process. The sound post production was completed in Brussels and includes recordings from deep within remote caves. ×

 the winds are getting strong. The real source of the ominous winds lies with Jina, who finds the strange word ‘LingLing’ written in her father’s notebook. She suspects he is cheating on her mother, who appears to be bored with life and fills the house with potted plants as if to show for her apathy. The film too is riddled with images of humid air and foul-smelling water, impure and overflowing. The sway of her father’s fishing pole and the flutters in Jina’s skirt seem perilous and unstable. When her anxiety and doubts finally come to a head, the family squarely face the rough downpour brought on by the storm. The director’s talent in boldly translating the characters desires and sensibilities into a narrative with powerful imagery is quite impressive. ×

Prince - Sign o’ the Times
 it was at this point that Prince decided to film a live concert promoting the new material, for eventual distribution to theaters in America.  Featuring the band that accompanied Prince on his 1987 Sign o’ the Times Tour, including dancer Cat Glover, keyboardist Boni Boyer, bassist Levi Seacer, Jr., guitarist Miko Weaver, drummer Sheila E. and former member of The Revolution keyboardist Dr. Fink, the film sees the group perform live on stage (although “U Got the Look” is represented by its promotional music video). ×
